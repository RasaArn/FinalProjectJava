üí° Project Idea:

The program is geography quiz that was created for learning purposes. The user can check their knowledge of capital cities for countries in 5 continents - Africa, Asia, South America, North America and Europe.

‚úèÔ∏è Structure of the Quiz

User must log in/ register and then choose the continent they want to play the quiz about. User gets question and needs to type the answer. The program compares the answer typed by user with the correct one which is stored in SQL database. After each question there is an option to see the correct answer if the user answered incorrectly, user can also choose not to check the correct answer. After each question the user chooses between continuing with the same continent or check the current score and go back to the main menu (choose a different continent)/ end quiz. There is no limit to the questions generated, the user can theoretically play for an infinite amount of time aka endless knowledge :) If user chooses to check score/ end quiz the program shows how many questions user had and how many of them were answered correctly, and gives a short motivational feedback (according to the percentage of correctly ansered questions).
