üí° Project Idea:

The program is geography quiz that was created for learning purposes. The user can check their knowledge of capital cities for countries in 5 continents - Africa, Asia, South America, North America and Europe.

‚úèÔ∏è Structure of the Quiz
The user must log in/register and then choose the continent they want to play the quiz about. The user gets a question and needs to type the answer. The program compares the answer typed by the user with the correct one, which is stored in an SQL database. After each question, there is an option to see the correct answer if the user answered incorrectly. The user can also choose not to check the correct answer. After each question, the user chooses between continuing with the same continent or checking the current score and going back to the main menu (to choose a different continent) or ending the quiz. There is no limit to the questions generated, so the user can theoretically play for an infinite amount of time until user decides to stop  the program. If the user chooses to check the score/end the quiz, the program shows how many questions the user answered and how many of them were answered correctly, and gives a short motivational feedback according to the percentage of correctly answered questions.
